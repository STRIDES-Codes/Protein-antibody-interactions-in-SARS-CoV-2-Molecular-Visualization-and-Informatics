## What is our problem?
The Covid-19 pandemic is a global health problem that has affected every facet of our lives. While the effects are evident, the science behind its cause can be inaccessible and lead to misconceptions. Additionally, people can be overwhelmed by the information that is available.

## What is our solution?
The **Website COVID-19 Variants:Structure and Effects on Human Health** aims to present information in a tangible way with structural visualizations. This allows users to engage with the material and help them understand how structure relates to function.
